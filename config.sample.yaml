# Denon AVR Proxy Configuration

# Copy this file to config.yaml and edit as needed.
#   cp config.sample.yaml config.yaml

# IP address or hostname of the physical Denon AVR.
# Default is empty (DEMO mode - no physical AVR; accepts clients but does not forward commands).
avr_host: ""

# Telnet port on the physical AVR (typically 23)
avr_port: 23

# IP address to bind the proxy server (0.0.0.0 = all interfaces)
proxy_host: "0.0.0.0"

# Port for clients to connect to (e.g., Home Assistant, UC Remote 3)
# Must be 23 - HA Denon integration does not support custom ports
proxy_port: 23

# Logging verbosity: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
log_level: "INFO"

# Command groups to log at INFO (others stay DEBUG when log_level is DEBUG)
# Groups: power (PW, ZM), volume (MV), input (SI), mute (MU), sound_mode (MS)
# log_command_groups_info: [power, volume]

# Custom input sources: map Denon function codes to display names in Home Assistant.
# Use this if you only use certain inputs and want names to match your AVR's custom names.
# Format: dict (func_code: "Display Name") or list of [func, name] pairs.
# func_code is what the AVR expects (e.g. CD, BD, HDMI1); display_name appears in HA.
# Omit or leave empty: with a physical AVR, sources are fetched from the device
# (including custom names); otherwise the default list is used.
# sources:
#   CD: "CD"
#   BD: "PlayStation"
#   HDMI1: "Apple TV"
#   HDMI2: "Cable Box"
#   NET: "Streaming"

# SSDP discovery (e.g. for Home Assistant auto-discovery)
enable_ssdp: true

# When SSDP is enabled: friendly name shown in Home Assistant
ssdp_friendly_name: "Denon AVR Proxy"

# When SSDP is enabled: port for serving device description XML (HA fetches this)
# Use 8080 to mimic real Denon AVRs; requires root for 80
ssdp_http_port: 8080

# When SSDP is enabled: IP to advertise in LOCATION
# Leave empty to auto-detect from primary interface
ssdp_advertise_ip: ""

# Optimistically update internal state when receiving commands, revert only if
# sending to the physical AVR fails. When no AVR is connected (e.g. testing),
# keep the optimistic state.
optimistic_state: true

# Delay (seconds) before broadcasting optimistic state to clients. Emulates AVR
# confirmation; avoids broadcasting change then immediately reverting on send failure.
optimistic_broadcast_delay: 0.1

# Web UI: monitoring dashboard and JSON API (disabled by default)
# When enabled: GET / = HTML dashboard, GET /status = JSON, POST /api/command,
# POST /api/refresh to request state from AVR
enable_web_ui: false
